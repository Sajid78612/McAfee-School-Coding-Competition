# McAfee-School-Coding-Competition

During my placement the McAfee outreach team reached out to me and asked to be a part of their School Coding Project. 
This is an annual project where every year the interns at McAfee are assigned a group of four Year 12 students from Buckinghamshire University Technical College (Bucks UTC). 
The project was a competition between each intern and their groups to see who could create a working video game while following sound software engineering principles. 
The roles of us interns were, to mentor the students and ensure they were keeping up with the work. 
The project lasted from October 2018 to February 2019 and involved us interns travelling once a week to Bucks UTC for 60 to 90 minutes to mentor our groups. 
The students had to present their final product at the end of February with a 15-minute presentation. 
The presentation was held at McAfeeâ€™s conference room in front of a panel of judges, interns, and their peers. 
Ultimately my group ended up winning the competition for having a fully functioning game with little to no defects and for adhering to the Software Engineering principles 
I guided them with.
