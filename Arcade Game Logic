7X6 = 42 total counters on the board
42/2 = 21 counters each
Starting counters: 10 for each player
Counters to gain: 32

Special positions on the board will exist that provide power ups, positioning on the row will be randomly generated
for each game. Power positions (PP from here on) higher on the board are more powerful, as it is in late game stages
we may want powers that disrupt arrangement or free up some space on the board.

On lower half of the board we can have PP with simple benefits such as +1 counters
on the very bottom and incrementing as we go higher on the board.

The number of counters represent how many more moves you can make we can extend the definition to represent it as a form of currency for late game.
We may trade counters for some power up counter if we land in a PP. e.g.

Trade 2 counters to make a black hole

Trade 5 counters to remove 1 counter on the board

Trade 10 counters to remove surrounding counters

trade 15 counters to ...

Trade 25 counters to reset the game



Example:
 *32 counters left to be claimed by players*

 *25 left to be claimed by players*

 Four +2 counters found in row 2

 *17 left to be claimed by players*

 Three +3 counters found in row 3

 *8 left to be claimed by players*
